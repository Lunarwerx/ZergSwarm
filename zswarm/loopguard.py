"""Tool-loop guard for the `api` worker loop: tells a worker it is repeating itself, and stops it once the
outcomes prove the repetition is going nowhere.

Why: cheap free models burn their whole max_turns re-reading the same file or re-running the same grep, and
before this the only exits were max_turns, cost and timeout - each of which fails the task after the budget
is already spent. A model-visible nudge at a repeat threshold recovers many of those runs; the ones it does
not recover end early as status `loop`, naming the detector, instead of timing out.

Every tool call is keyed on its name plus its arguments as canonical JSON (keys sorted at every depth, so
{"a":1,"b":2} and {"b":2,"a":1} are one call) and on a hash of what it returned. Detectors over that history:

- repeat: the same call N times in a row. Advisory only - a reminder is appended to that call's own tool
  result at REPEAT_WARN (gentle first, then detailed). The result may differ each time (a file being
  edited, a test being re-run), so this detector never ends a task.
- no_progress: the same call returning the same result every time. Warns like repeat and ends the task at
  NO_PROGRESS_STOP in a row.
- ping_pong: two calls alternating A, B, A, B with each returning what it returned last time. Warns at
  PING_PONG_WARN, ends the task at PING_PONG_STOP.
- global: one (call, result) pair seen GLOBAL_STOP times anywhere in the task, however interleaved - the
  circuit breaker for a longer cycle the other detectors do not see.

submit_result is transparent: it is the way out of the loop, never part of one.

Ideas from deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness (packages/guard/repeat-tool-reminder, MIT) and openclaw/openclaw
(src/agents/tool-loop-detection.ts, MIT); written fresh for zswarm, no code copied.
