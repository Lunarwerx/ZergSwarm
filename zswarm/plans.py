"""Recipe plan cache: the read-only tool calls of a recipe run that passed, replayed before the model plans again.

WHY: a recurring job runs the same named recipe over differently shaped inputs and pays the model to rediscover the
same reads every time. What is cached is the PLAN (which files to list, glob, grep and read), never the answer, so a
replay is still correct on new input: the calls run against today's files and the model answers from today's bytes.
Idea from Microsoft PowerToys Advanced Paste (MIT), which caches a named action's tool-call chain rather than its
output; no code of theirs is used.

Rules that keep it honest:
- Only a task carrying a `recipe` id is cached. A free-text prompt never is, and the prompt itself is never stored:
  the key is (recipe, input shape, zswarm version) and the value is the tool calls.
- Only read-only tools are recorded (REPLAYABLE). A write or a shell command replayed on new input would change the
  worker's tree on the strength of a different run's reasoning.
- Any replayed call that errors drops the whole replay and the model plans from scratch, as if there were no plan.
- A plan recorded by another zswarm version (or another tool contract) is dropped, never replayed.

State: <ZSWARM_HOME>/plans.json, machine-local. Only the api backend replays; cc runs Claude Code's own loop.
