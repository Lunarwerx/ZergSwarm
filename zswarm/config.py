"""Configuration: paths, providers, models, roles, pricing, peak/off-peak, and API-key resolution.

Providers are OpenAI-compatible chat endpoints, one TOML file each: the shipped ones in zswarm/providers/, a
person's own in ~/.zswarm/providers/ (docs/PROVIDERS.md). Adding a provider, a model or a key is a file, never a
code change (owner asks, Michael, 2026-09-15 and 2026-09-26: "configurable expandable easy files ... so they aren't
spread all over"). ROLES map a kind of work to a model, so a task can say role: "search" and get whatever is wired
for it on this machine (~/.zswarm/settings.toml).

Prices are USD per 1M tokens. A model with no price on record costs None ("not measured", never
zero), which the ledger prints as '-'. Only DeepSeek has peak/off-peak pricing.

The API keys are resolved at runtime and never logged or printed. `key_status()` is the only
inspection surface and reports presence, length and a short fingerprint only.
