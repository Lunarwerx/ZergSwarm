"""Checked work: a task's opt-in `verify` runs after the worker finishes, and a failed check sends the task back to a
worker with the failure appended, a capped number of times, so the caller gets a PASS or one escalation record
instead of a plausible claim it has to re-run itself.

Two checks, either or both. `command` runs in the task's cwd through the harness (never the worker), and its exit
code is the verdict. `judge` is the acceptance criteria, scored by the judge role against a PASS/FAIL schema with
typed issues and per-criterion status; it runs only once the command (if any) has passed, so a red build never
costs a judge call. The whole loop, judge calls included, stays inside the task's `max_cost_usd`.

Ideas from msitarzewski/agency-agents (QA verdict, retry with the issue list, escalation after 3 attempts) and
multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills ("[step] -> verify: [check]"), both MIT; written fresh for zswarm."""
