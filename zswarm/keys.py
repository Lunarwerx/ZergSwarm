"""The key-pool report and the disabled slot: `zswarm keys`, `keys probe`, `keys enable`, `keys disable`.

One row per key per provider, fingerprints only - a key is never returned, printed or logged. The four
verbs are the whole surface an operator needs when a key runs out:

  zswarm keys                      what every pool looks like right now (no network call)
  zswarm keys probe                one FREE GET per key; a topped-up key comes back out of the slot here
  zswarm keys enable <fp>|--all    take a key out of the slot by hand
  zswarm keys disable <fp>         put one in by hand (a key you want to stop using without deleting)

Why the slot exists (owner ask, Michael, 2026-09-17): "when any key runs out of DeepSeek or OpenRouter,
have it go to, like, a disabled slot so it's not constantly retried." Disabling is sticky - no timer, no
ladder - so a spent key never costs another worker to rediscover. The way back is a free probe or one of
the verbs above.
