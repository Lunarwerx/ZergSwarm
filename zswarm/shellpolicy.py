"""The worker shell policy: every command a bash line would run, checked against prefix rules before it runs.

WHY: a worker's shell runs in the caller's working tree, and a worker that is refused and retries is exactly the
one that finds a wrapper around a one-regex gate. So the line is split into the commands it really runs
(shellparse), each is canonicalized (shellcanon), and each is matched against declarative prefix rules:
zswarm/shell_rules.toml, then ~/.zswarm/shell_rules.toml on top. A rule carries its own match / not_match
examples and they are run when the file loads, so a broken rule fails loudly instead of silently passing
everything. The longest matching prefix decides (ties go to forbidden), a forbidden rule's justification says
what to do instead, and a run-time word ($VAR, $(...)) where a forbidden rule looks counts as a match.
A task can hold prefix grants (`shell_grants: ["git add"]`) that lift non-hard rules for that command
prefix; nothing lifts a hard rule or the fixed rm -r deny below.
