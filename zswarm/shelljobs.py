"""Background shell jobs for the `api` backend: start a command, keep working, read it later.

The bash tool blocks the worker's turn until the command ends (up to 900 s) and hands back every
byte, spinner frames and colour codes included. A build, a test watcher or a dev server wants the
opposite: start it, get a job id, then wait with a bound, read a window of its output, feed it a
line, or kill it. Output is sanitized as it streams (ANSI escapes dropped, a carriage-return
progress line collapsed to its last frame) and kept as decoded text, so every offset is a
character offset and a window can never split a UTF-8 sequence. stdout and stderr are kept both
interleaved and apart, so a machine-readable command's stdout can be read alone.

Idea adapted from dify-agent-runtime's shellctl (tmux jobs, a PTY sanitizer, offset/tail windows);
written fresh here, no code copied.
