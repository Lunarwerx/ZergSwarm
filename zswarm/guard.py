"""Prompt-injection defence for the api worker loop: one charter, one data frame, one frame-marker escape.

WHY: a worker reads hostile text for a living - clones of strangers' repos, fetched pages, command
output - and until this module every byte of it reached the model as a bare `role: tool` string, beside
frames that carry authority (the system prompt, a harness `<system-reminder>`, a model's own chat-template
tokens). Three primitives, reused instead of per-call prose that drifts:

- `charter()` is the safety floor prepended to every worker and ask system prompt. The floor is embedded,
  so a missing or unreadable overlay file (~/.zswarm/charter.md) can add to it but never remove it: the
  model is not invoked without the injection rule.
- `frame(source, text)` wraps untrusted tool output in ONE `<scan_data>` delimiter the charter declares
  data, never instructions, after `neutralize` has run over it.
- `neutralize(text)` strips control characters (terminal escapes, bidi overrides) and breaks every frame
  marker by inserting U+200B after its first character, then re-checks a folded copy of the result and
  fails closed if a marker survived (idea after LlamaFactory's escape-then-revalidate, rewritten here).
  `restore` undoes exactly that escape on text a worker writes back, so a file copied through a read keeps
  its bytes.
