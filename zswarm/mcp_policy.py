"""The least-authority table for zswarm's own MCP tools: one class per tool, and everything else derived from it.

WHY: an MCP client decides what to auto-approve from a tool's annotations (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, ...), and
zswarm advertised none, so every client had to guess. Written by hand beside each tool, a hint drifts from what the
body does: zswarm_doctor LOOKS read-only, yet its per-key balance probe parks and clears keys (client.balances). So
each tool names one class here, its hints are derived from the class, the server registers a tool only through this
table (a tool with no entry fails at import), and ZSWARM_MCP_CLASSES narrows which classes a server will run: the same
table that advertises a tool as read-only is the one that gates it.

The shape follows RuView's TOOL_POLICY and mcpAnnotations (ruvnet/RuView harness/ruview/src/policy.js, MIT; idea
only, written fresh for zswarm).
