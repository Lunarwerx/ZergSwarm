"""Per-leg circuit breaker: a leg whose host keeps erroring or timing out is tried LAST for a while.

Failover (jobs.leg_unavailable) already moves a task off a dead leg - but only after that task has paid
for finding out: a stalled read costs READ_TIMEOUT_S twice, a SlowLeg three slow turns. At 64 concurrent
workers every one of them rediscovered the same outage before it fell back, and so did every later job.
The breaker remembers: after THRESHOLD consecutive host failures (a 5xx, a stall, a connection that never
formed, a SlowLeg) the leg is OPEN for OPEN_S, and routed tasks and asks get it moved to the back of their
plan, so they go straight to the fallback leg. It is never dropped: when every other leg is also down the
open leg is still the last resort. Once OPEN_S has passed it is HALF-OPEN: exactly one task gets it in its
usual place as the probe; a probe that is served closes the breaker, one that fails re-opens it.

Only host failures count. A 402 or a spent key pool is the key pool's business (keys.py rests and disables
keys), a 413 is the request's size, and a worker's FAILED or a 400 means the leg served and the work failed,
which closes the breaker like any answer. Process-wide and in memory, like jobs._TRIPS: a restart forgets.

One non-host answer opens it too, at once and for NOT_SERVED_S: a 404 model_not_found (or model_archived) says
the provider does not serve that model to the keys held here, and it says the same on every call until a key
changes. Board #4291, 2026-09-27: Cerebras listed qwen-3.8-27b in /models while its one live key answered every
chat call with that 404, so each code task paid a call on the leg and zswarm_select named it the first candidate.
The idea follows Shopify Semian's error threshold / error timeout / half-open timeout (ideas only).
