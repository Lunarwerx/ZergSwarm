"""The spawn envelope: what a whole spawn TREE may do, narrowed at every hop, and the per-tree ledger that admits it.

WHY: max_cost_usd caps one worker and budget_usd caps one job, but a cc worker runs full Claude Code and can start
a job of its own (through a project's zswarm MCP entry or `zswarm.py run`), whose workers can do the same. Nothing
capped that TREE, and nothing stopped a worker from handing its children wider tools or a bigger budget than it was
given. Idea adapted from AutoGPT's copilot spawn tree (autogpt_platform/backend/backend/copilot/tree.py, ideas only).

- An envelope is set at a root job (zswarm_run `envelope`, `zswarm.py run --envelope`) and every task of that job
  carries it. A cc worker gets it in ZSWARM_ENVELOPE (claude_env.cc_env), so any zswarm the worker starts inherits
  it; the shared HTTP server reads the X-Zswarm-Envelope header instead, never its own environment.
- A child envelope is derived from its parent ONLY by narrowing: depth + 1 toward max_depth, tools intersected,
  spend ceiling / node cap / deadline each the min of parent and request. A request cannot widen anything, and a
  task asking for tools outside its envelope is refused by name, not silently cut down.
- The tree ledger (~/.zswarm/trees/<root>.json, shared by every zswarm process on the machine) admits a job only
  while the tree's metered spend is under spend_usd and its node count stays within max_nodes.

HONEST BOUND: spend is METERED when a task finishes, not reserved when it starts, so admission cannot see what
in-flight tasks will cost. A tree can therefore end above spend_usd by what its in-flight tasks spend: at most
max_nodes tasks, each clamped at admission to max_cost_usd <= the ceiling's remainder. The node cap is what makes
that overshoot finite. It is a guard against a model widening its own delegation, not a sandbox: a worker with the
`all` preset has a shell and can unset its own environment.
