"""Review with an evidence bar: the contracts review roles carry, and the checks that need no model.

WHY (harvest 2026-09-25): cheap reviewer workers hand back confident findings nobody can check ("this field
does not exist") and flag code the change never touched, and the orchestrator pays to re-read every one. So:
- the `judge` role carries an evidence bar: say what you read, cite path:line with the verbatim quote and a
  concrete failure mode or it is only a question, at most five nits, a re-review reports only the delta;
- every finding's quote is checked MECHANICALLY against the file it cites, and one that is not there is
  demoted below the display line before the orchestrator reads it;
- each finding is anchored in_diff / off_diff by 3-gram overlap with the diff's changed lines, and a
  `refute` worker with repo read access then tries to disprove each one (attacker and victim named, cited
  evidence only, default SURVIVES, off_diff held to a stricter bar); a refute pass that fails keeps them all;
- the `doubt` role reviews an ARTIFACT against its CONTRACT and is never handed the author's claim, which
  biases a reviewer toward agreeing; its issues come back in a fixed precedence, and two or more cycles with
  substantive issues but nothing actionable is flagged as doubt theater.

Ideas from anthropics/claude-code security-guidance (diff anchor and adversarial refute; ideas only),
addyosmani/agent-skills doubt-driven-development, garrytan/gstack's confidence gate and electron/electron
REVIEW.md. Written fresh for zswarm; no code copied. Nothing here talks to the network; run_review and
run_doubt drive the JobManager they are handed."""

JUDGE_CONTRACT = """Evidence bar for every finding you report:
- First say what you could see: the files you actually read. A claim about code you did not read is not a finding; ask it as a question (severity "question").
- An "important" finding needs a path and line in a file you read, the verbatim line(s) that motivate it in `quote`, and a concrete failure mode (the input or sequence that breaks, and what happens). Missing any of the three, it is a question.
- `quote` is copied character for character from the file, without line-number prefixes. A finding whose quote is not in the cited file is dropped before anyone reads it.
- At most 5 nits; give a count of the rest instead of listing them.
- Report nothing a compiler, type checker, linter, formatter or the test suite already enforces.
- On a re-review, report only important findings, and for each earlier finding whether it is now fixed."""

REFUTE_CONTRACT = """You are the refute pass. Each candidate finding below came from another reviewer. Try to DISPROVE each one by reading and searching the repository.
- For each finding name the attacker (who or what triggers the failure) and the victim (who or what is harmed). No plausible attacker and victim means the finding is refuted.
- Refute only with cited evidence: a path:line you read showing the code does not behave as claimed (a guard, a caller that never passes that value, a test that pins the behaviour). Doubt without a citation is not a refutation.
- When unsure, the finding SURVIVES.
- A finding marked off_diff cites code the change did not touch. Hold it to a stricter bar: list it as survived only when you confirmed the failure yourself and it is reachable from the changed code.
- Submit `survived` (the indices that stand) and `refuted` (one entry per refuted index, with attacker, victim and the path:line evidence)."""

# The `review` role's rubric (config.ROLES wires its model). Authorship-neutral on purpose: the task and the code

RUBRIC = """You review a change made for a task. Judge the change against the task and the code, never against its author: who or what wrote it decides nothing.

Read the diff and every file it touches before you judge. The change's own description, commit message and comments are claims, not evidence: the code is the evidence.

Weigh three kinds of evidence:
- problem: does the change address the problem the task states? Point at the lines that do, or say what is missing.
- solution: is it correct and complete, consistent with the code around it, and free of regressions?
- ownership: does every changed file and hunk exist because the task needs it?

Report each problem as a finding with an exact path, side (old or new) and line range, and one of these shapes:
- defect: a bug, a regression or a broken contract.
- scope_drift: files or hunks the task does not need: renames, reformatting, unrelated refactors, drive-by fixes.
- test_padding: tests that pin nothing the change does, repeat existing ones, or would still pass with the change removed.
- defensive_padding: guards, fallbacks or try/except for cases that cannot happen, added to look careful.
- explanation_only: a resubmission whose code did not change, only its explanation, message or comments.
- other: anything else that blocks acceptance.

Rerun stability: the verdict follows the code. The same code judged again gets the same verdict; a rewritten explanation with no code change never earns a better one.

Verdict: accept when there is no defect and no scope_drift; revise when the fixes are small and named; reject when the change does not address the task or its evidence is missing."""
