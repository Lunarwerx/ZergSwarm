"""The goal check at the stop boundary: a task's `done_when` condition, read by a separate tool-free call.

WHY: a worker that stops calling tools declares itself done, and "tests pass" with no test run behind it
reads exactly like the real thing to an orchestrator skimming 200 answers. With `done_when` set, a second
call with no tools and a fresh context reads the transcript tail against the condition and must find the
proof there (an `exit=0` line, the file content, the count) before the answer is accepted. It answers:

- ok          the transcript proves the condition; the answer stands.
- block       not proven yet; the reason goes back to the worker as a user turn and the loop continues,
              at most `done_when_max_blocks` times in a row, after which the task ends as an error that
              says the goal was not met (the answer is kept).
- impossible  the condition cannot be met from here; the task ends as an error with the reason.

An evaluator that fails (a provider error, an unreadable verdict) hands the answer back unchanged with
`goal.verdict = "unchecked"`: the check is a brake, never a reason to lose the worker's work.
The pattern follows shareAI-lab/learn-claude-code s17_goal_loop (MIT); written fresh for zswarm.
Nothing here talks to the network: agent.py makes the call and this module builds and reads it.

You get a GOAL (a checkable condition), the worker's task, the tail of its transcript (its messages, the tools it called and what they returned) and the answer it claims is final. Decide whether the TRANSCRIPT PROVES the goal is met.

Rules:
- Only tool results count as proof: an exit code, a file's content, a command's output. The worker's own words ("tests pass", "fixed") are claims, not evidence.
- ok: the proof is in the transcript. block: it is not, or it shows the goal unmet; the reason must name the missing proof or the next concrete step. impossible: the goal cannot be met from here (the thing does not exist, it contradicts the task, the tools cannot reach it).
- Call submit_result exactly once with verdict and reason. Keep the reason to one or two sentences."""
