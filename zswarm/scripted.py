"""Scripted-diff: a mechanical change that carries the script which made it, proved by replaying the script.

WHY: a rename or sweep diff is long and a reviewer has to read all of it to trust it. When the change
ships with the few lines of shell that produced it, and a machine replays those lines on the starting
tree and gets the identical tree, the reviewer reads the script and the replay vouches for the diff.
Idea from bitcoin/bitcoin test/lint/commit-script-check.sh (MIT); written fresh for zswarm.

Two entry points share one replay:
- the `scripted` task mode (spec.Task.scripted): the worker edits its cwd AND submits the script; JobManager
  snapshots the cwd before the worker starts and `settle` accepts the result only when the replay, run on a
  throwaway worktree holding that snapshot, reproduces the worker's working tree exactly;
- `zswarm scripted check [RANGE]`: every commit titled `scripted-diff:` must carry its script between the
  marker lines and replay to its own tree from its parent; marker lines under any other title fail too.

Trees are compared as git tree hashes (untracked files included, ignored files excluded), written through a
temporary index so the caller's real index is never touched.
