"""Out-of-process permission broker: the sandbox asks a separate process before it runs a shell command or writes a file.

The api backend's Sandbox keeps a worker inside its roots, but inside them `bash` and the write tools
had no policy at all. A policy that lives in the same process as the code it governs is one import
away from being patched out, so the decision is made by a broker program the operator names in
ZSWARM_PERMISSION_BROKER. zswarm starts it once per process and every worker's check goes over its
stdin/stdout, one JSON line each way (the shape follows Deno's permission broker, denoland/deno
runtime/permissions/broker.rs, MIT - idea only, written fresh here):

    request  {"v": 1, "pid": <zswarm pid>, "id": <n>, "datetime": "<utc iso>", "permission": "run"|"write", "value": "<command or absolute path>", "cwd": "<worker cwd>"}
    reply    {"id": <n>, "result": "allow"|"deny", "reason": "<shown to the model on deny>"}

It fails CLOSED: a broker that cannot start, dies, answers late, answers another id or an unknown
result raises BrokerUnavailable, which the tool dispatcher does not swallow, so the worker aborts
instead of running the action unchecked. The broken process is dropped and the next check starts a
fresh one. No env var, no broker, nothing changes.
