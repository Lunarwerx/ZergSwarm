"""Tolerant old_string location for edit_file: a line-level edit-distance match plus reindent.

edit_file tries the exact substring first. When that has no hit, the usual cause is drift in a block
the worker copied from read_file - indentation, trailing spaces, an LF old_string against a CRLF file -
and a cheap worker burns turns retrying it. This module finds the block the model meant, line by line,
and reindents new_string to that block. It is deliberately conservative: a short old_string must match
every line (whitespace aside), a longer one tolerates about one wrong line in five, and two equally good
blocks are refused rather than guessed. Idea after Zed's streaming fuzzy matcher (asymmetric line costs,
a similarity bar for "the same line", reindent by the indent delta); written fresh for zswarm.
