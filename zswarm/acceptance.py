"""Acceptance criteria a task carries, decided in code after the worker stops.

Why: a task used to succeed when the worker said so. A task may now name typed leaves, and each is
checked against the sandbox and the record of what the worker actually ran, so a fan-out of
code-changing tasks comes back "status ok, 3/3 criteria hold" instead of "status ok" on trust.

    file:<path>            the file exists and is not empty
    file_written:<path>    the worker itself wrote it this run (write/edit tool), and it reads back non-empty
    tests_passed:<command> a bash call the worker made ran exactly that command, exit 0, with a test summary
                           in the tail of its output (N passed, OK, ok, test result: ok, ...)

Anything else, and anything the record cannot settle, is UNVERIFIED: never passed on a guess.
The bash record is the Sandbox's receipt ledger (receipts.py): each bash receipt keeps its command, exit
code and output tail, so nothing new is recorded here.
The idea comes from bytedance/deer-flow (MIT) backend/packages/harness/deerflow/subagents/acceptance_checks.py;
the code here is written fresh for zswarm's Sandbox and receipt ledger.
