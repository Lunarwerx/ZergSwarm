"""Edit survival: did the code a worker wrote stay written?

A task that finished "ok" says the worker stopped, not that its edit was any good. The cheap, language-agnostic
signal is what happened to the edit afterwards. When an api worker first touches a file its Sandbox keeps the
text as it was (`originals`); at task end snapshot() pairs that with the text the worker left, and the job
journal stores the pair under ~/.zswarm/edits/<job>/<task>.json. score_due() later compares both with the file
on disk now, at three checkpoints (5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day after the task), appends one line per checkpoint to
~/.zswarm/survival.jsonl and drops the snapshot after the last one. ledger.ledger_rows joins the newest score
onto the task's ledger row as `survival`, and ledger_summary averages it per model, so legs can be ranked by
whether their edits were kept and not only by whether the task finished.

Two numbers per task, each 0..1 (the idea is VS Code Copilot's edit-survival tracker, written fresh here):
  four_gram  the share of the text the worker ADDED that is still in the file (character 4-gram overlap, so a
             reformat or a small tweak keeps most of the credit and a rewrite loses it).
  no_revert  1 minus how far the file moved back toward its pre-task text: 0 when someone restored the old
             file (or deleted a file the worker created), 1 when the edit stands or was changed into something new.
