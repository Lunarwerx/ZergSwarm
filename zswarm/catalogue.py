"""`zswarm models`: list what this machine can address, and pull a provider's live catalogue and prices.

OpenRouter fronts ~440 models whose rates change without notice, so hard-coding a price table here would
be inventing a number - the one thing the ledger must never do. Instead `zswarm models --refresh openrouter`
reads the provider's own /models endpoint and writes what it says into config.CATALOGUE_FILE, which reload()
layers UNDER the user's provider files. Until a refresh has run, an `or:<id>` model has no price on
record and its cost reads '-' - except that OpenRouter reports the real charged cost on every call, so a
priced table is a convenience here, not the source of truth.

OpenRouter quotes USD per TOKEN as strings; the registry is USD per 1M tokens, so every figure is scaled
by a million on the way in. `input_cache_read` is the cache-hit rate where the model has one.
