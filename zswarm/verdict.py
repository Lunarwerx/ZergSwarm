"""Can this machine's swarm take work at all? One offline answer, cached where the routing gate reads it.

~/.zswarm/verdict.json is read by the agent_routing_gate hook (claude-memory home/hooks/agent_routing_gate.py):
a FRESH `usable: false` makes the gate stop recommending the swarm and accept a Claude fan-out that names its
model. Found 2026-09-21 on Jacob's PC: every zswarm_run errored "No deepseek API key found" in 0.0 s while the
gate kept sending every session there, because nothing it could read said so.

It judges the AUTO routes a plain zswarm_run takes (tool-using, tool-free, and cc's own), from the shared key
state only - no network call, so the server can write it at start and a job can rewrite it when it ends in
NoUsableKey. A leg counts when its provider has a key that is not disabled; a resting (429) key still counts,
because a rate limit passes and a missing key does not. Fingerprint-free: no key, and no fingerprint, is written.
