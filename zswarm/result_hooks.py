"""The one-file result loop for a `cc` worker: three Claude Code hooks that turn "write exactly one
result file and make it valid" from prose a worker can ignore into a contract it cannot.

An api worker gets this from submit_result: one call carries the answer and a missing required key
comes back as a tool error while the worker still has a turn. A cc worker is headless Claude Code,
which has no submit_result, so a task that names a `result_file` gets these instead:

- PreToolUse on the edit tools: every write that is not the result file is DENIED, and anything the
  hook cannot read (bad JSON, no path) is denied too - it fails closed. Every attempt is logged, one
  sanitised line each, so the orchestrator can see what a worker tried to touch.
- PostToolUse on the same tools: after a write to the result file the file is validated and any
  error goes back to the model as additionalContext; a valid file says nothing.
- Stop: a missing or invalid file blocks the stop ONCE (exit 2, the errors on stderr), so the worker
  fixes it while it still has a turn; `stop_hook_active` lets the second stop through, no loop.

The same `validate` reads the file after the run (cc.read_result_file), so a file that passed the
hook is exactly a file that publishes. The idea is from pytorch/pytorch's PR-review hooks
(.claude/hooks/pr_review/, BSD-3-Clause); this is written fresh for zswarm.

Stdlib only and runnable as a script: Claude Code runs it in the worker's own folder, where the
zswarm package is not importable. Usage: python result_hooks.py pre|post|stop <spec.json>
