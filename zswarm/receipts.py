"""The tool-receipt ledger: what an `api` worker actually did, checked against what it says it did.

A worker's final message is free text, and the orchestrator used to re-verify every "done" by hand.
Here every Sandbox call is stamped as a numbered receipt r1..rN (tool, args hash, ok/ERROR, output
sha256; a bash call also keeps its exit code, command and output tail), the worker is told to cite
[rN tool] for each action it claims, and two verdicts come back on the Result:

- citations: resolved / mismatched / unknown / uncited, so the orchestrator re-checks only the
  claims no receipt backs.
- green: for a task that asked for green evidence at a level, whether the "done" names a passing
  command receipt at that level (and, at merge_ready, the base sha a git receipt printed), with
  the list of what is missing.

Ideas from bytedance/deer-flow (tool receipts and cited self-reports, MIT) and ultraworkers/claw-code
(the evidence-graded green contract, MIT); written fresh for zswarm, no code copied.
