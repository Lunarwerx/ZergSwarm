"""Teacher escalation: a cheap worker that GAVE UP is re-run once on a stronger model the caller named, and a fix
that holds is banked as a skill the cheap worker is handed on the next task like it.

Failover (jobs.leg_unavailable) moves a task only when a leg cannot serve; it never re-runs the task's own
failure, because on the same tier that doubles the spend for the same answer. A give-up is different when the
next model is STRONGER: the cheap worker said FAILED, asked a question it was told never to ask, or ended on a
run of tool errors, and a better model with the failed trace in hand often finishes it. So a task that sets
`escalate` (a model name) gets exactly one such retry, costed on its result, and nothing else changes.

The failed trace goes to the teacher wrapped as UNTRUSTED_TRACE: it can quote files, web pages and tool output
written by anyone, and a skill distilled from it is read by later workers as guidance, so an instruction planted
in a fetched page must not become one. Skills land under ~/.zswarm/skills/ marked `trust: unreviewed`.

The idea (a regex tier that flags a failed turn, a teacher that sees the trace behind a guard, a skill kept only
when the teacher's own reply passes the same check) comes from odysseus-dev/odysseus; no code was taken.
