"""Pluggable tool runtimes: WHERE an api worker's tools run, not only which paths they may touch.

Sandbox (tools.py) confines paths, but its bash is this machine's shell. A task's `runtime` field moves
every tool into an isolate instead:

- "" or "host" (the default): this machine, unchanged.
- "docker-container:<id>" / "podman-container:<id>": `exec -i` into a RUNNING container (zswarm never starts one).
- "ssh:<target>": a remote host, an ssh config alias or user@host, non-interactive (BatchMode, keys only).

This module is the transport: it parses the spec and builds the host argv that runs one POSIX sh script
in the isolate, in the task's cwd, under the isolate's own `timeout N` with a host-side guard of N + 5 s
behind it. The tools themselves (RemoteSandbox) are remote_tools.py. The idea follows llama.cpp's server
tools runtime layer (tools/server/server-tools.cpp, MIT); the code is written fresh for zswarm.
