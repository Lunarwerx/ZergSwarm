"""Fault injection: fail a chosen provider call on demand, so every failover path is testable.

WHY: leg failover (jobs.leg_unavailable, route_plan) was only ever proven on the outages that happened to
occur. A fault spec armed here makes ChatClient.chat raise a provider error BEFORE the request is sent -
no spend, no network - so a test or a deliberate drill can fail exactly the Nth call to a leg and watch
the task walk the rest of its route. Idea from the Linux kernel's fault-injection attributes
(probability, interval, times, fail-the-Nth); written fresh for zswarm.

Armed two ways, both process-wide:

- `ZSWARM_FAULTS` in the environment: specs separated by `;`, each a comma list of key=value, e.g.
  `ZSWARM_FAULTS="provider=groq,nth=2;provider=openrouter,probability=0.3,times=5,status=429"`.
  Re-read whenever the variable's value changes (counters start over then).
- `arm(...)` / `clear()` from a test.

Keys: `provider` (a provider name or `*`, default `*`), `model` (a resolved model name; empty matches any),
`nth` (calls before the Nth matching one never fail; 0 = from the first), `times` (how many calls may fail,
default 1; -1 = no limit), `interval` (only every Kth matching call may fail), `probability` (0..1, default 1),
`seed` (makes probability reproducible), `status` (the HTTP status to fake, default 503 - an unavailable leg;
400 fakes the task's own failure, which must NOT fail over; 504 fakes a stalled read). So `nth=3` alone
fails exactly the third matching call and no other. Only the api backend's calls pass through here: a cc
worker's requests are made by Claude Code, not by this client.
