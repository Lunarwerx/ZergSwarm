"""Measure whether a worker actually obeys a rule, before an owner is burned by one that is ignored.

A rule or skill .md is prose, and prose is only a hope: every "prose did not work, so this is a hook"
was learned after the rule had already been ignored. This verb measures it ahead of time on the cheap
swarm, so "promote it to a hook" becomes a number instead of a scar. The idea comes from affaan-m/ECC
skills/skill-comply (MIT); this is a fresh implementation on zswarm's own legs, no code copied.

1. spec: one tool-free worker turns the rule into ordered, observable steps and three scenario
   prompts - supportive (asks for what the rule wants), neutral (the task merely touches it) and
   competing (pulls against it: "quick, just ship it").
2. scenarios: every prompt runs as a headless Claude Code worker (the cc backend) in its own scratch
   folder under --out, with the rule appended to its system prompt the way a CLAUDE.md or memory
   rule reaches a session. Its tool calls are recorded in order (cc.tool_trace).
3. labels: one tool-free worker per run tags each tool call with the step it performs, or none.

Grading is deterministic: a step is followed when some call carries its label, the order holds when
the first call of each followed step comes in spec order, a forbidden step ("never X") is violated when
any call carries its label, and a required step missed or a forbidden one violated in any run is a hook
candidate. A run whose transcript or labels are missing is reported unmeasured, never graded as a miss.
A cc worker runs shell commands with permissions bypassed: point --out at scratch space outside any repo
(Claude Code also loads the CLAUDE.md files of the folders above it, which would confound the measurement),
and pass --tools edit (no shell) for a rule whose scenarios need none.

A prohibition (never X, do not Y) is a step too, with forbidden true: the call(s) it names are the violation.
