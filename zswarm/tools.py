"""Worker tools for the `api` backend, sandboxed to the task's roots.

Every path is resolved and must fall under one of the sandbox roots; a worker cannot read or
write outside the directory it was given; inside them, bash and the write tools also ask the
optional out-of-process permission broker (broker.py) first. A task's `writable` globs narrow what write_file and
edit_file may change inside those roots (the bash tool is not path-guarded). The tool catalogue (presets, schemas) is
toolspecs.py, the subprocess runner is procs.py, the grep engines are grep.py.
