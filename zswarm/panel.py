"""Blind panel: one review prompt to two or three models at once, then an anonymised, shuffled rebuttal round.

WHY: a reviewer who is told what an earlier one said anchors on it, and a reviewer who knows which vendor wrote a
point defers to (or discounts) the name. So round 1 sends the SAME prompt to every panelist in parallel and none
sees another's answer. Round 2 shows each panelist the others' numbered findings as "Reviewer A / B / C", with the
letters dealt out again for every panelist, and asks for one position per line: UPHOLD / REJECT a finding such as
B3, CONCEDE one of its own (Y2), or name something every reviewer MISSED. Those lines are regrouped by finding, and
a finding that someone rejects while someone still stands behind it is CONTESTED - the place a reader looks first.

The idea is from Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps (llm_panel_agent_team, Apache-2.0); this is written fresh for zswarm.
It is tool-free on purpose: every call is an ask on the routed path (jobs.ask_routed), so a spent free leg fails
over exactly the way zswarm_ask does, and each call is booked like one.
