"""Offline: each built native scanner (Rust, Go) returns exactly the Python reference's numbers on a
fixture that exercises every rule: replayed requestIds across files, main-before-sub attribution, an
out-of-window record, an unpriced model, 1-hour cache writes, and threaded vs single-threaded folds.
Skipped for an arm whose binary is not built (`python zswarm.py native build`)."""
