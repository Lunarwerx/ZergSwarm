"""zswarm_review / zswarm_doubt (zswarm/review.py): the evidence bar is enforced mechanically, not only asked for.

Pinned: a finding whose quote is not in the file it cites never reaches the shown list (cheap reviewers'
confident "field does not exist" false positives); each finding is anchored in_diff / off_diff against the
diff; the refute pass drops only on cited evidence, holds off_diff findings to a confirmation, and a pass that
fails keeps everything; the doubt cycle's precedence and doubt-theater stop; a review role carries its
contract into the task. No model is called: the job manager is a fake.
