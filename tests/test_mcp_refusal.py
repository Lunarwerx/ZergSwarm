"""zswarm_run must return a refused task spec's REASON, never raise it into the MCP layer.

Measured 2026-09-19: reasoning_effort="medium" raised ValueError inside zswarm_run, FastMCP reduced it
to "Error executing tool zswarm_run", and the caller lost two batches bisecting its arguments. The tool
is called directly here (no server), so this fails against the old code with the ValueError itself.
