"""Offline: a finished task is labelled by whether it moved the work, not just whether it replied.

A worker `ok` whose answer is "I'll inspect..." or "blocked on credentials" reads as done to an orchestrator
skimming statuses; classify_liveness turns those into planning_only / blocked_external / approval_required so
the caller continues or escalates them. Pinned here because the failure is silent: a no-op counted as a result.
