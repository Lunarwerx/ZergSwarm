"""Offline: the reserve-then-settle ceilings and the wrap-up checkpoint (zswarm/budget.py).

WHY these tests: before budget.py the worker cap and the job budget were checked AFTER the turn (or task) that
crossed them, so a worker overshot max_cost_usd by a turn and a job with N workers in flight overshot budget_usd
by up to N workers' spend. Each test below fails with the reservation (or the checkpoint) taken out."""
