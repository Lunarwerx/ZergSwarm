"""Offline: price-aware routing between paths to the same model.

Owner ask, Michael, 2026-09-17: "lets default to openrouter when off-peak hours and use deepseek when
it costs half as much" - read as meant, take whichever path is cheaper right now. Priced alone that is:

  * OFF-PEAK: DeepSeek halves its own rates ($0.0683/1M blended) and beats OpenRouter's flat leg.
  * PEAK:     OpenRouter steered to DeepInfra ($0.20/$0.60, verified against billed cost) is $0.0861
              against DeepSeek's $0.1365.

But price is not the whole rule. The benchmark the same day put the OpenRouter leg at 45/50 against
direct's 49/50 (the gap all on exact counting), ~4x slower per call, and serving 29 of 99 calls from an
fp4 host despite the steer. Owner doctrine is "cheaper only with NO regression", so that leg is a
FALLBACK: it serves only when DeepSeek has no key with credit, until a benchmark earns it
`fallback = false` in the user's own provider file. Price orders legs within a tier, never across tiers.

Comparison is on the MEASURED token mix (65.1% cache hits, 31.8% miss, 3.1% out across 7,577 api rows
in this machine's ledger), never on one rate.
