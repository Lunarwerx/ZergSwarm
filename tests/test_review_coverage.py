"""Offline: a review task that declares an `inventory` must hand back a `reviewed_paths` receipt equal to it.

Contract: the receipt is checked by zswarm, not trusted from the worker - in the worker loop (a partial receipt is a
tool error the model can fix) and again at the job gate (whatever the backend, an ok result without a matching
receipt ends as IncompleteReview). Regression it catches: a cheap worker reads three files of ten and its
"reviewed, no issues" comes back ok. Also pins the `review` role's rubric and default schema being attached.
